      <section class="profile-text">
        <p>
          Over the course of this term, my understanding of social work has
          evolved from a broad awareness of systemic issues to a deeply personal
          and actionable commitment to ethical, empathetic, and skill-based
          practice. Each module has shaped a different dimension of my emerging
          professional identity, and together they form a unified framework for
          how I approach clients, advocacy, and systemic change.

      <!-- Four Pillars Diagram -->

        <h2>The Four Pillars of My Practice</h2>
        <div class="pillars-container">
          <div class="pillar">
            <h3>Historical & Systemic Awareness</h3>
            <p>
              From Module 1, I gained a historical and systemic awareness of the
              roots of social inequities. I learned how colonialism, economic
              policy, and systemic discrimination continue to shape the lived
              realities of marginalized populations. This knowledge sharpened my
              ability to see beyond the surface of individual struggles and
              recognize how structural forces contribute to challenges like
              poverty, institutional neglect, and unequal access to services.
              Understanding the Herron nursing home tragedy, for example, is
              impossible without acknowledging the long-standing systemic
              underfunding of elder care and the undervaluing of caregiving
              work.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="pillar">
            <h3>Communication & Advocacy Skills</h3>
            <p>
              In Module 2, I developed communication and advocacy skills that
              allow me to translate that systemic awareness into action. I
              learned to craft messages that balance compassion with clarity,
              and to advocate for clients both at an interpersonal level and
              within broader policy contexts. Whether through motivational
              interviewing to build trust with a client or presenting
              well-documented concerns to decision-makers, I now see
              communication not just as a skill, but as a tool for empowerment
              and systemic change.
            </p>

          <div class="pillar">
            <h3>Empathy Breakthroughs</h3>
            <p>
              Module 3 deepened my empathy in a way that reshaped my practice.
              My "empathy breakthroughs" were not just about feeling compassion,
              but about cultivating the capacity to fully understand and
              validate a client's lived experience. I came to appreciate that
              empathy is a disciplined skill: it requires humility, patience,
              and the willingness to see the world through the client's
              perspective without letting my own biases overshadow their voice.
              In the context of long-term care, this means truly listening to
              residents' fears and needs, even when they conflict with
              operational pressures.

          <div class="pillar">
            <h3>Ethical Convictions</h3>
            <p>
              Finally, Module 4 cemented my ethical convictions as the
              foundation of my practice. My personal ethics manifesto: centered
              on respect for the inherent dignity and worth of persons, and
              integrity in professional practice: serves as a compass in moments
              of moral uncertainty. These values compel me to act decisively
              when I witness neglect, to uphold transparency with clients and
              families, and to advocate for systemic reforms that prevent harm.

        <h2>Integrated Practice</h2>
        <p>
          Taken together, these modules have given me not just theoretical
          knowledge, but an integrated professional identity. I am committed to
          practicing with systemic awareness, advocating with clarity and
          courage, engaging with clients through disciplined empathy, and
          holding myself accountable to unwavering ethical standards. In every
          interaction: whether one-on-one with a client or in challenging
          institutional policies: my goal is to embody a social work practice
          where dignity, advocacy, empathy, and integrity are inseparable.
