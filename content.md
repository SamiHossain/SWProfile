Culminating Final Integrated Profile

Over the course of this term, my understanding of social work has evolved from an abstract awareness of systemic issues to a fully formed professional identity grounded in history, advocacy, empathy, and ethics. Each module in this course has built a distinct pillar of my practice, and together they create a cohesive framework for how I approach clients, communities, and systemic change.

Module 1 – Historical and Systemic Awareness

I developed a deep understanding of how historical and structural forces shape present-day inequities. Studying examples like the underfunding and neglect of elder care systems, I saw how colonialism, economic austerity, and discriminatory policies converge to create harm that is often misattributed solely to individual failings. This awareness allows me to contextualize clients’ struggles within broader systems of power and oppression. It also sharpened my ability to identify root causes and resist “quick-fix” solutions that fail to address systemic harm.

Module 2 – Communication and Advocacy Skills

I learned to translate systemic insight into practical action. My communication training focused on both interpersonal and institutional advocacy, whether through active listening and motivational interviewing with clients or presenting evidence-based arguments to decision-makers. These skills are grounded in clarity, compassion, and strategic framing, ensuring that my advocacy both amplifies client voices and advances policy-level change. I now see communication not just as dialogue, but as an intervention that can shift power and outcomes.

Module 3 – Empathy Breakthroughs

My understanding of empathy matured from simply “feeling for someone” to actively centering their lived experience without judgment or projection. I learned that empathy is a disciplined, intentional practice, one that requires slowing down, suspending assumptions, and prioritizing the client’s worldview. In contexts like long-term care, this means truly listening to residents’ needs, validating their fears, and resisting pressures to prioritize efficiency over dignity. This shift has made my practice both more humane and more effective.

Module 4 – Ethical Convictions

Through developing my personal ethics manifesto, I anchored my practice in the principles of dignity, integrity, and justice. These values function as a compass when navigating moral complexity. They require me to act when I see harm, to remain transparent with clients and stakeholders, and to advocate for systemic reforms even when doing so is uncomfortable. My ethical stance is not just reactive; it shapes the proactive choices I make in service of long-term, equitable outcomes.

Integrated Practice

These four pillars: historical/systemic awareness, communication and advocacy skills, disciplined empathy, and unwavering ethics are inseparable in my approach to social work. They inform every decision I make, from how I listen to a client’s story to how I challenge institutional norms. My professional identity is now grounded in the belief that meaningful change happens when we simultaneously see the big picture, speak truth to power, connect deeply with individuals, and uphold ethical commitments without compromise.

Module-by-Module Reflections
Module 1: Historical Foundations, Theories, and Ethics in Social Work

When I started Module 1, I thought I understood the basics of social work: helping people, advocating for change, being compassionate. But diving into Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 8 of Ives, Denov, and Sussman (2020) challenged me to see social work as something far more layered. I learned that it’s deeply rooted in history, influenced by Indigenous, French, and English traditions, and constantly shaped by the ethical choices we make as practitioners.

What struck me most was the recognition of how Canada’s colonial history still shapes present-day inequities. Reading about Indigenous approaches to care made me question why those perspectives have so often been sidelined in mainstream practice (Ives et al., 2020), and how much harm that has caused. It made me realize that being a social worker isn’t just about helping individuals; it’s about understanding and addressing the historical and systemic forces that create the conditions they live in.

The case study on The nursing home that lost nearly 50 seniors to COVID-19 (CBC News, 2020) was painful to watch. Seeing such an immense loss, knowing it happened under conditions where neglect and lack of preparedness were possible factors, left me unsettled. When I created my concept map, I applied the structural social work framework to highlight how systemic issues: underfunding, privatization, lack of culturally safe care contributed to the tragedy. It reminded me that social work practice can’t be separated from policy and advocacy.

This module validated my belief in empathy, but it also challenged me to think critically about how I show that empathy. I can’t just focus on immediate needs; I have to see the bigger picture: history, systems, and power dynamics. As someone with coding skills, I even started thinking about how technology could be used to track and flag unsafe conditions in care facilities before tragedies happen. This idea excites me because it’s where my tech background and growing social work perspective could meet.

By the end of Module 1, I learned that my role as a future social worker would require me to balance compassion with a deep commitment to systemic change. I can’t “fix” a single problem without looking at the web of historical and structural factors behind it. This is a shift in thinking that will shape everything I learn going forward.

Module 2: Social Work with Individuals, Families, Groups, and Communities

In Module 2, the focus shifted from history and theory to the real, human connections that make social work possible. Chapters 4 and 5 in Ives, Denov, and Sussman (2020) helped me understand that working with individuals or families requires a very different approach than working with groups or communities, but both start with the same foundation: trust.

Writing my letter to the editor for Transformative Social Work (2024) was the first time I felt like I was speaking directly into a professional space. The documentary I analyzed showed the complexity of supporting people whose struggles intersect with issues of diversity, inequality, and systemic barriers. Through the lens of diversity, I saw how identity factors like culture, socioeconomic status, and lived experience fundamentally shape the challenges people face and the ways they may experience support.

When I broke down my strategies into micro, mezzo, and macro levels, it became clear to me how interconnected those layers are. At the micro level, it’s about building genuine relationships: listening without judgment, being present. At the mezzo level, it’s about connecting people with community resources and support networks that reflect their needs and identities. And at the macro level, it’s about challenging the structures that keep them in cycles of disadvantage. I realized that social work is like a web: if one strand is weak, the whole structure suffers.

Distilling all of that into a TikTok-style advocacy video was surprisingly powerful. It forced me to strip away jargon and academic language, to speak in a way that could reach someone scrolling on their phone between classes or work shifts. It made me think about accessibility: not just of services, but of the conversations we have about social issues. Social work shouldn’t live only in textbooks or conferences; it should exist in everyday dialogue.

This module validated my belief in creativity as a tool for change. My tech and media skills became an asset here, helping me translate professional insights into something people outside the profession could engage with. It also pushed me to think critically about impact: how will I know if my actions are working? That question about evaluation is one I’ll keep asking, because without it, even the best intentions can fade into empty gestures.

By the end of Module 2, I saw myself not just as someone learning social work theories, but as someone learning to be a communicator: a bridge between complex issues and public understanding. And that feels like a role I could truly thrive in.

Module 3: Social Work in Diverse Fields of Practice

Module 3 was the most personal and emotionally revealing part of this course for me. Reading Chapters 6 through 13 in Ives, Denov, and Sussman (2020) was like opening a series of windows into worlds I had only glanced at before: health care, child welfare, work with immigrants and refugees, sexual and gender diversity, disability advocacy, aging populations, and international practice. But the section on social work with aging immigrant populations hit me with a force I wasn’t prepared for.

I’ve grown up with a constant hum of pressure from my immigrant mother: a pressure to achieve, to secure stability, to “prove” that her sacrifices in coming to Canada were worth it. For years, I saw this as a generational clash, a culture gap, or even a personal flaw on her part. I took her criticisms of my career progress, like struggling to secure a computer science internship, as attacks rather than expressions of care.

But as I engaged with the course material, I learned about how aging immigrants often experience a loss of identity, social standing, and security in a new country. They may face isolation, cultural disconnection, and unacknowledged grief. Suddenly, my mother’s words and actions made sense in a different light. Her urgency for me to succeed wasn’t about control; it was her way of protecting me from the uncertainty she’s felt since she left her home. It was survival disguised as discipline.

This realization shook me because it reframed years of family dynamics. I began to see the emotional labor my mother has carried, almost invisibly, in our home. She never had access to mental health resources. She never had someone to help her process the cultural dislocation she endured. So she turned that energy inward, transforming it into expectations for her children, hoping our achievements could anchor her in a world that still feels unstable to her.

In this module, I also learned that concepts like cultural humility and anti-oppressive practice are not just tools for the workplace; they’re tools for life. Applying them to my relationship with my mother has made me more patient, more curious, and less defensive. Now, instead of shutting down during her lectures about “success,” I try to listen for the fear underneath, and respond with empathy.

This was the first time I understood that social work isn’t always about a client in an office; it can be about the way you speak to your own family over dinner. It’s about noticing where power, privilege, and identity intersect in even the most personal relationships. This module gave me the language and the framework to rewrite the story I’ve been telling myself about my family, and about myself. And that is a change I’ll carry for the rest of my life.

Module 4: Ethics, Regulation, and Personal Values in Social Work

Module 4 brought everything back to the core of the profession: ethics, values, and the responsibility we carry as social workers. Revisiting Chapter 3 in Ives, Denov, and Sussman (2020) and exploring the Canadian Association of Social Workers Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice (CASW, 2005) reminded me that while compassion and skill are essential, they are not enough without a strong ethical foundation.

When I created my personal social work ethics manifesto, I chose two values that resonated deeply with me: respect for the inherent dignity and worth of persons and integrity in professional practice. These are more than just abstract principles; they are promises I would make to every client I serve.

The Herron nursing home tragedy, which I studied earlier in the course, kept coming back to my mind. Upholding dignity in that context means never allowing a person to be reduced to a “case” or a “bed number.” It means recognizing their history, honoring their voice, and protecting their right to make choices about their own care, even in moments of crisis.

Integrity, for me, is about courage and accountability. It’s the willingness to speak up when something is wrong, to document and report neglect, to be transparent with both clients and their families, and to follow through on commitments. It’s about knowing that silence in the face of harm is its own form of complicity.

If I had been working at Herron, I would have applied these values through relationship-based practice: conducting thorough needs assessments, actively listening to residents and families, and using motivational interviewing to build trust. But I wouldn’t stop at the interpersonal level; I would also push for systemic change by documenting policy violations, addressing staffing shortages, and advocating for better training and resources.

What struck me during this module was that ethics are not passive rules; they are active commitments. They should shape my actions in the moment, but also guide my long-term advocacy. The phrase that kept coming to mind while I was writing was: “Ethics don’t live in binders; they live in how we show up.”

By the end of this module, I realized that my manifesto wasn’t just an assignment; it was a personal pledge. Whether I’m working directly with clients, collaborating with colleagues, or using my tech skills to create solutions in the social work space, dignity and integrity will be the constants I return to. They are my non-negotiables.
