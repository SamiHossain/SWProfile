          <h3>Module Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            When I started Module 1, I thought I understood the basics of social
            work: helping people, advocating for change, being compassionate.
            But diving into Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 8 of Ives, Denov, and Sussman
            (2020) challenged me to see social work as something far more
            layered. I learned that it's deeply rooted in history, influenced by
            Indigenous, French, and English traditions, and constantly shaped by
            the ethical choices we make as practitioners.
          </p>

          <p>
            What struck me most was the recognition of how Canada's colonial
            history still shapes present-day inequities. Reading about
            Indigenous approaches to care made me question why those
            perspectives have so often been sidelined in mainstream practice
            (Ives et al., 2020), and how much harm that has caused. It made me
            realize that being a social worker isn't just about helping
            individuals; it's about understanding and addressing the historical
            and systemic forces that create the conditions they live in.
          </p>

          <p>
            The case study on The nursing home that lost nearly 50 seniors to
            COVID-19 was painful to watch. Seeing such an immense loss, knowing
            it happened under conditions where neglect and lack of preparedness
            were possible factors, left me unsettled. When I created my concept
            map, I applied the structural social work framework to highlight how
            systemic issues: underfunding, privatization, lack of culturally
            safe care contributed to the tragedy. It reminded me that social
            work practice can't be separated from policy and advocacy.
          </p>

          <p>
            This module validated my belief in empathy, but it also challenged
            me to think critically about how I show that empathy. I can't just
            focus on immediate needs; I have to see the bigger picture: history,
            systems, and power dynamics. As someone with coding skills, I even
            started thinking about how technology could be used to track and
            flag unsafe conditions in care facilities before tragedies happen.
            This idea excites me because it's where my tech background and
            growing social work perspective could meet.
          </p>

          <p>
            By the end of Module 1, I learned that my role as a future social
            worker would require me to balance compassion with a deep commitment
            to systemic change. I can't "fix" a single problem without looking
            at the web of historical and structural factors behind it. This is a
            shift in thinking that will shape everything I learn going forward.

          <p>
            In Module 2, the focus shifted from history and theory to the real,
            human connections that make social work possible. Chapters 4 and 5
            in Ives, Denov, & Sussman (2020) helped me understand that working
            with individuals or families requires a very different approach than
            working with groups or communities, but both start with the same
            foundation: trust.
          </p>

          <p>
            Writing my letter to the editor for Transformative Social Work was
            the first time I felt like I was speaking directly into a
            professional space. The documentary I analyzed showed the complexity
            of supporting people whose struggles intersect with issues of
            diversity, inequality, and systemic barriers. Through the lens of
            diversity, I saw how identity factors like culture, socioeconomic
            status, and lived experience fundamentally shape the challenges
            people face and the ways they may experience support.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I broke down my strategies into micro, mezzo, and macro levels,
            it became clear to me how interconnected those layers are. At the
            micro level, it's about building genuine relationships: listening
            without judgment, being present. At the mezzo level, it's about
            connecting people with community resources and support networks that
            reflect their needs and identities. And at the macro level, it's
            about challenging the structures that keep them in cycles of
            disadvantage. I realized that social work is like a web: if one
            strand is weak, the whole structure suffers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Distilling all of that into a TikTok-style advocacy video was
            surprisingly powerful. It forced me to strip away jargon and
            academic language, to speak in a way that could reach someone
            scrolling on their phone between classes or work shifts. It made me
            think about accessibility: not just of services, but of the
            conversations we have about social issues. Social work shouldn't
            live only in textbooks or conferences; it should exist in everyday
            dialogue.
          </p>

          <p>
            This module validated my belief in creativity as a tool for change.
            My tech and media skills became an asset here, helping me translate
            professional insights into something people outside the profession
            could engage with. It also pushed me to think critically about
            impact: how will I know if my actions are working? That question
            about evaluation is one I'll keep asking, because without it, even
            the best intentions can fade into empty gestures.
          </p>

          <p>
            By the end of Module 2, I saw myself not just as someone learning
            social work theories, but as someone learning to be a communicator:
            a bridge between complex issues and public understanding. And that
            feels like a role I could truly thrive in.

          <h3>Module Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            Module 3 was the most personal and emotionally revealing part of
            this course for me. Reading Chapters 6 through 13 in Ives, Denov, &
            Sussman (2020) was like opening a series of windows into worlds I
            had only glanced at before: health care, child welfare, work with
            immigrants and refugees, sexual and gender diversity, disability
            advocacy, aging populations, and international practice. But the
            section on social work with aging immigrant populations hit me with
            a force I wasn't prepared for.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've grown up with a constant hum of pressure from my immigrant
            mother: a pressure to achieve, to secure stability, to "prove" that
            her sacrifices in coming to Canada were worth it. For years, I saw
            this as a generational clash, a culture gap, or even a personal flaw
            on her part. I took her criticisms of my career progress, like
            struggling to secure a computer science internship, as attacks
            rather than expressions of care.
          </p>

          <p>
            But as I engaged with the course material, I learned about how aging
            immigrants often experience a loss of identity, social standing, and
            security in a new country. They may face isolation, cultural
            disconnection, and unacknowledged grief. Suddenly, my mother's words
            and actions made sense in a different light. Her urgency for me to
            succeed wasn't about control; it was her way of protecting me from
            the uncertainty she's felt since she left her home. It was survival
            disguised as discipline.
          </p>

          <p>
            This realization shook me because it reframed years of family
            dynamics. I began to see the emotional labor my mother has carried,
            almost invisibly, in our home. She never had access to mental health
            resources. She never had someone to help her process the cultural
            dislocation she endured. So she turned that energy inward,
            transforming it into expectations for her children, hoping our
            achievements could anchor her in a world that still feels unstable
            to her.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this module, I also learned that concepts like cultural humility
            and anti-oppressive practice are not just tools for the workplace;
            they're tools for life. Applying them to my relationship with my
            mother has made me more patient, more curious, and less defensive.
            Now, instead of shutting down during her lectures about "success," I
            try to listen for the fear underneath, and respond with empathy.
          </p>

          <p>
            This was the first time I understood that social work isn't always
            about a client in an office; it can be about the way you speak to
            your own family over dinner. It's about noticing where power,
            privilege, and identity intersect in even the most personal
            relationships. This module gave me the language and the framework to
            rewrite the story I've been telling myself about my family, and
            about myself. And that is a change I'll carry for the rest of my
            life.

          <p>
            Module 4 brought everything back to the core of the profession:
            ethics, values, and the responsibility we carry as social workers.
            Revisiting Chapter 3 in Ives, Denov, and Sussman (2020) and
            exploring the Canadian Association of Social Workers Code of Ethics
            and Standards of Practice reminded me that while compassion and
            skill are essential, they are not enough without a strong ethical
            foundation.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I created my personal social work ethics manifesto, I chose two
            values that resonated deeply with me: respect for the inherent
            dignity and worth of persons and integrity in professional practice.
            These are more than just abstract principles; they are promises I
            would make to every client I serve.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Herron nursing home tragedy, which I studied earlier in the
            course, kept coming back to my mind. Upholding dignity in that
            context means never allowing a person to be reduced to a "case" or a
            "bed number." It means recognizing their history, honoring their
            voice, and protecting their right to make choices about their own
            care, even in moments of crisis.

            Integrity, for me, is about courage and accountability. It's the
            willingness to speak up when something is wrong, to document and
            report neglect, to be transparent with both clients and their
            families, and to follow through on commitments. It's about knowing
            that silence in the face of harm is its own form of complicity.

            If I had been working at Herron, I would have applied these values
            through relationship-based practice: conducting thorough needs
            assessments, actively listening to residents and families, and using
            motivational interviewing to build trust. But I wouldn't stop at the
            interpersonal level; I would also push for systemic change by
            documenting policy violations, addressing staffing shortages, and
            advocating for better training and resources.

            What struck me during this module was that ethics are not passive
            rules; they are active commitments. They should shape my actions in
            the moment, but also guide my long-term advocacy. The phrase that
            kept coming to mind while I was writing was: "Ethics don't live in
            binders; they live in how we show up."

            By the end of this module, I realized that my manifesto wasn't just
            an assignment; it was a personal pledge. Whether I'm working
            directly with clients, collaborating with colleagues, or using my
            tech skills to create solutions in the social work space, dignity
            and integrity will be the constants I return to. They are my
            non-negotiables.
